<p><strong>PROCEDURE:</strong> Lumbar Epidural Steroid Injection</p>

<p><strong>INDICATION:</strong> The patient has lumbar radiculopathy with associated pain.</p>

<p><strong>PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:</strong><br>
After informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the prone position. The lumbar spine was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the epidural space was accessed at the {side_level} level using a {needle_size} needle via {approach} approach. Loss of resistance technique was used to confirm epidural placement. Contrast medium was injected to confirm appropriate spread. The following medications were injected: {medications}.</p>

<p><strong>COMPLICATIONS:</strong> None</p>
