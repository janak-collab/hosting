# GMPM System Update - June 11, 2025

## üìç IMPORTANT: Documentation Moved
Main documentation is now at: `~/docs/README.md`

## Key Changes:
- ‚úÖ Removed all test files from production (security improvement)
- ‚úÖ Consolidated documentation to ~/docs/
- ‚úÖ Single backup script: ~/scripts/backup_gmpm.sh  
- ‚úÖ Confirmed FastRoute routing system

## For Team Members:
- **Docs**: Use `~/docs/README.md` (not old files)
- **Backups**: Use `~/scripts/backup_gmpm.sh`
- **Architecture**: FastRoute in `~/app/src/Router.php`

System works exactly the same for users - just cleaner backend!
